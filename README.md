**Visualizations**
The purpose of the project is to better understand earthquakes, in terms of force and impact. Different metrics to describe earthqaukes is being visualized by a histogram. The counts of earthqauked by each metric is being depicted. 

Plotly.js is being used to depict the histogram. Bootstrap, version 5.3.0-alpha3  is a CSS framework being used to have better stylistic display. As mentioned before the purpose of my project is to visualize earthquakes in a more speicfic way by visualizing the count of earthquakes in the world by the different metrics being used. Hence, people will have a clearer and more in depth understanding of what type of earthquakes are impacting the world and how to tackle them.
